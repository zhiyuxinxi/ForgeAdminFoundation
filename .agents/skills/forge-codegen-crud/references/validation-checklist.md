# Validation Checklist

## Generated SQL

- [ ] Flyway filename uses the next unused version and lower snake case description.
- [ ] Existing-table migrations guard every `DROP INDEX` with `information_schema.STATISTICS` and tolerate renamed, missing, or partially migrated legacy indexes.
- [ ] Business table has `id`, `tenant_id`, `create_by`, `create_time`, `create_dept`, `update_by`, `update_time`.
- [ ] Logical-delete tables contain `del_flag`; no visible `logic_delete_active` generated column is created.
- [ ] A business key that is active-only unique uses `(business_key..., del_flag)` with `BIGINT/Long` and `@TableLogic(delval = "id")`; tables without this requirement do not add the index mechanically.
- [ ] Custom logical-delete SQL for an active-only unique key writes the current primary key, never the fixed value `1`.
- [ ] Active-only uniqueness does not rely on `(business_key, deleted_at)` with `deleted_at = NULL`; MySQL allows multiple `NULL` values in a unique index.
- [ ] Built-in data uses `tenant_id = 1`, never `0`.
- [ ] Every insert has explicit column names.
- [ ] Every dictionary/resource/Excel seed has `NOT EXISTS` protection.
- [ ] Dictionary fields either reuse an existing `dict_type` or add `sys_dict_type` and `sys_dict_data`.
- [ ] Import/export pages include `sys_excel_export_config` and `sys_excel_column_config` rows.
- [ ] `sys_resource` inserts create the menu and required button permissions.

## Backend

- [ ] An ordinary maintainable ledger has real pagination/filter/detail/add/edit/single-delete support; any omitted operation has an explicit business basis, not just a missing endpoint.
- [ ] DTO validation, action permissions and trusted tenant/data scope execute on the actual API path; detail/edit/delete check the original record's scope, state and references. Failures have safe, useful project-standard feedback.
- [ ] IDs, dictionary codes, dates/timezones, nulls and pagination match the public frontend contract; public dictionary/member/file owners are reused and existing attachments, children and signatures are preserved.
- [ ] Controller uses `RespInfo.success(data)` / `RespInfo.success()` and Forge codegen-safe routes.
- [ ] Generated detail/update/delete endpoints use POST (`/getById`, `/edit`, `/remove/{id}`); no `@PutMapping` or `@DeleteMapping` is generated.
- [ ] Pagination uses `PageQuery` or `pageNum` + `pageSize`, not `page`.
- [ ] Query SQL lives in Mapper XML.
- [ ] Mapper XML lists explicit columns and includes standard audit fields.
- [ ] Sensitive or encrypted endpoints use `@ApiDecrypt` and `@ApiEncrypt`.
- [ ] Service methods validate required IDs and uniqueness before writes.
- [ ] No Service-to-Service circular dependency is introduced.
- [ ] Multi-select deletion can use the existing single-delete API and public per-item handling. A backend batch endpoint is optional; when present, it bounds/validates IDs and enforces the declared atomic or per-item outcome contract without discarding failures.
- [ ] Apply the affected boundaries in `code-copilot/rules/coding-style.md` 8.6: public member/file/dictionary/numbering owners, stable user IDs, ordinary-save field allowlists, original-object scope, server-owned transitions, request-content idempotency and real datasource transactions.
- [ ] For current-member selection/validation, consume `TenantMemberDirectory` from starter-core; compare all required IDs, use bounded direct-org cursor pages, and keep historical identity display separate from current active-member eligibility. Do not import system implementation services or repeat their membership SQL.
- [ ] Metadata edits cannot overwrite balances or flow fields from stale loaded entities; list/detail/export are read-only. Batch relationship validation and child inserts are bounded and grouped rather than one query per row.
- [ ] Tests/evidence cover the actual changed negative and concurrency paths; compile or source-string assertions are not reported as runtime proof.

## Frontend

- [ ] Page uses `AiCrudPage`.
- [ ] `api-config` uses `:id` placeholders, not `{id}`.
- [ ] Generated `api-config` uses POST for detail/update/delete (`post@.../getById`, `post@.../edit`, `post@.../remove/:id`); no `put@` or `delete@` is generated.
- [ ] Dictionary fields use `useDict()`, `DictSelect`, and `DictTag`.
- [ ] Schemas are `computed` when they depend on dictionaries.
- [ ] Import/export props and API config match generated backend or common Excel endpoints.
- [ ] Image/file fields use file IDs and `AuthImage` or `getFileUrl(fileId)`, not raw avatar URLs.
- [ ] Operation links use semantic UnoCSS classes such as `text-primary`, `text-error`, `text-warning`, and `text-success`.

## Verification Commands

Run the narrowest useful checks for the generated scope:

```bash
cd forge && mvn -pl forge-admin-server -am compile -DskipTests
```

```bash
cd forge-admin-ui && source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use v20.19.0 && pnpm build
```

If the full commands are too expensive, run module-specific compilation/lint and state what was not run.
